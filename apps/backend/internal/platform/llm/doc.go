// Package llm holds the provider adapters (Anthropic-compatible and
// OpenAI-compatible). Each adapter translates the internal message format into
// one provider wire format and normalises the streaming events back.
//
// The domain contract — Provider, ChatRequest, StreamEvent, Capabilities —
// lives in internal/modules/llm/domain and is owned by EPIC 4 (#34). Nothing in
// this package may be imported by another module's domain or service; only the
// container wires adapters into services.
